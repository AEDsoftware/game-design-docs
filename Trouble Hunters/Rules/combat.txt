Combat

You can't easily open fire against someone who's in close combat with you, unless they have no interest in or ability to stop you (if so, just do your harm). If you open fire against another PC, they make their coming under fire roll first (which you can interfere with), then you make your open fire roll (which they can interfere with). If you open fire on someone and they fire back, you come under fire yourself. If you come under fire and fire back, you open fire.

In close combat with another PC, you'll usually alternate committing to fight, starting with whoever commits first and going back and forth until the situation changes enough to stop it.
